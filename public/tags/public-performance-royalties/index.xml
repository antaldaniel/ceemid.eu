      <description>In our analysis, smaller societies under political influence could often not raise their revenues in line with the rising incomes of their economies. While the Baltics, the CEE and SEE region are not so poor compared to Western Europe as they used to be 20 years ago, most tariffs are way below reasonable levels. This is an opportunity. At the same time some societies are charging rather high and disputable tariffs in some cases to make up the revenue.</description>

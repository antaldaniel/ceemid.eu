      <description>What are CAP Surveys? Cultural Access and Participation Surveys are standardized surveys designed to measure various market-based and non-market based (amateur, liturgical, etc.) cultural activities, including concerts, streaming subscriptions, singing, etc. They are based on various quantative sociological models and had been standardized by the Eurostat working group ESSNet-Culture.
The CEEMID CAP surveys are usually live interviews that allow cross-country comparison, and they are used both for market forcasting, market analytics, royalty and compensation value setting.</description>

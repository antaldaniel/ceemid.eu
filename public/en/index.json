Ljubjlana, Zagreb, Budapest and Prague are full with life and concerting opportunities in December, but the difference in interest for concerts among peak months and low month can be as much as 40%, about the double of the all-year Viennese market. Summer festivals obviously alter the picture, but it is essential for tour organizers as well as concert promoters to understand seasonality and to build longer tour seasons in these countries. Cultural spending is not necessarily low in off-peak season but may be diverted to cinema, theatres or outdoor activities.\nWe use R program code to retrieve concert, cinema, theatre and other relevant search information from web searches and Youtube. We produce data that is comparable across the whole CEE region. We make time-series, forecasting, benchmarking and other data analytics applications on the data. The main use is forecasting, because tickets sales are known when searched for and not after sales are reported. The granularity of the data can help to understand seasonality of months, weeks, best time for touring, for cinema scheduling.\nOur Google Trend Analytics is included in our private and public reports. Google Trends is an interesting toy if you use it interactively. Combined with regular, programmatic data extraction and surveys it is an extremely powerful tool to provide timely forecasts and to give your surveys an extra granularity in time, or down to city level. For example, combining seasonality analytics with demographic analysis can explain most of the difficulties of market development in the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland or Slovakia.\n","date":1508450400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508450400,"objectID":"c2514b18263e772f93bc784eb102dce9","permalink":"/en/post/google_trends_seasonality/","publishdate":"2017-10-20T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/en/post/google_trends_seasonality/","section":"post","summary":"Google Trends data combined with regular, programmatic data extraction and surveys it is an extremely powerful tool to provide timely forecasts and to give your surveys an extra granularity in time, or down to city level.","tags":["seasonality","Google","concerts","benchmarking","bestweek","ticket-sales"],"title":"National And Regional Google Analytics Is Back","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"In our analysis, smaller societies under political influence could often not raise their revenues in line with the rising incomes of their economies. While the Baltics, the CEE and SEE region are not so poor compared to Western Europe as they used to be 20 years ago, most tariffs are way below reasonable levels. This is an opportunity. At the same time some societies are charging rather high and disputable tariffs in some cases to make up the revenue.\nWe started a cooperation with a few societies in 2014 to prepare for such an outcome, and to justify the differences among royalty tariffs in the EU. Our benchmarking reveals which tariffs can be disputed, and which tariffs may have leeway for increase.\nTariffs should be set to a level that music can be best exploited in broadcasting, digital, hotels, restaurants, clubs and all locations where people want to enjoy a better ambiance instead of noise. Too high tariff are illegal and will eventually result in less use of music.\nOur experience with competition cases and regulatory approvals can help to review your tariffs, identify the threats and opportunities, and to balance them in a way that benefits your members and your users as well. We believe that our benchmarks fulfill the criteria set out by the ECJ in AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome, but it goes beyond the imagination of the parties involved in the case.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging.

The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location.

For example, we are re-using price survey data in the relevant sectors that is used for inflation calculation or survey data collected about digital service in the EU. The re-use of this data significantly reduces market research and data collections or surveying costs, and increases value with international and historical comparison ability.\nSurvey Data We are creating online surveys for musicians and filmmakers, and commissioning nationally representative Cultural Access and Participation surveys as primary data sources. You can read more about this in the Survey section of the page.\nIndustry sources We are collecting many indicators published by industry associations. We also integrate non-public, membership-based data in our work for our clients, such as IFPI and CISAC internal financial tables.\nBig data We are collecting data from various ‘big data’ sources to understand seasonality of demand or expected competition among events in a certain city. Big data sources often offer a more precise, relevant and cheaper alternative to consumer surveys. For example, we can analyze ticket sales seasonality with the help of Google search volumes or understand the popularity of a concert in the context of geolocational real-time data on other events in the neighborhood.\nIntegrating Outside Data With Client Financial And Transactional Data We are integrating statistical data, open data, survey data, industry sources and big data sources with our Clients internal financial and transactional data put the Client’s data into context.

Cultural Access and Participation Surveys are standardized surveys designed to measure various market-based and non-market based (amateur, liturgical, etc.) cultural activities, including concerts, streaming subscriptions, singing, etc.  They are based on various quantative sociological models and had been standardized by the Eurostat working group [ESSNet-Culture](http://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/culture/library/reports/ess-net-report_en.pdf).

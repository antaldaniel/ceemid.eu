## Statistical data

The CEEMID system regularly harvests Eurostat and national statistical office data, and compiles the new data into comparable format, for example, via valid currency translations.  Our automatic data retrieval makes sure that we always have the latest data available. 

## PSI, OpenStatistics, OpenGov

Following the EU directive on the re-use of public sector information, open statistics and open government initiatives, we are using raw data collected for statistical or research purposes and creating new statistical products. For example, we are re-using price survey data in the relevant sectors that is used for inflation calculation or survey data collected about digital service in the EU. The re-use of this data significantly reduces market research and data collections or surveying costs, and increases value with international and historical comparison ability.

##Survey Data

We are creating online surveys for musicians and filmmakers, and commissioning nationally representative Cultural Access and Participation surveys as primary data sources. You can read more about this in the Survey section of the page. 

##Industry sources 

We are collecting many indicators published by industry associations.  We also integrate non-public, membership-based data in our work for our clients, such as IFPI and CISAC internal financial tables. 

##Big data

We are collecting data from various ‘big data’ sources to understand seasonality of demand or expected competition among events in a certain city.  Big data sources often offer a more precise, relevant and cheaper alternative to consumer surveys.  For example, we can analyze ticket sales seasonality with the help of Google search volumes or understand the popularity of a concert in the context of geolocational real-time data on other events in the neighborhood.

##Integrating Outside Data With Client Financial And Transactional Data

We are integrating statistical data, open data, survey data, industry sources and big data sources with our Clients internal financial and transactional data put the Client’s data into context.  For example, we can analyze the gains/losses in public performance licenses in the context of international royalty tariffs, local purchasing power, tourisms flows, seasonal factors and so on.

## What are Music Industry Professional Surveys?

The __Music Industry Professional Surveys__ and the similar _Audiovisual Industries Professional Surveys_ were designed to fill out the gaps from other data sources.  These surveys are anonymously asking music and film professionals about their work, their royalties and other incomes, and some budgetary issues.  The CEEMID Music Professional Surveys are among the biggest musician surveys, besides the survey supporting the [UK Measuring Music Surveys]( https://www.ukmusic.org/research/measuring-music-2017/).

The three income streams model is essentially a value chain based model that was developed in the United States and adopted by the European Commissionâ€™s Joint Research Center for [European creative and cultural policy purposes](http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC69881/jrc69881.pdf). We made minor adaptations in the three income model for applicability in Central Europe.

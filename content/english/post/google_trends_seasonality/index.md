An important aspect of the relatively week CEE markets is the very strong seasonality aspect.  Ljubjlana, Zagreb, Budapest and Prague are full with life and concerting opportunities in December, but the difference in interest for concerts among peak months and low month can be as much as 40%, about the double of the all-year Viennese market.  Summer festivals obviously alter the picture, but it is essential for tour organizers as well as concert promoters to understand seasonality and to build longer tour seasons in these countries.  Cultural spending is not necessarily low in off-peak season but may be diverted to cinema, theatres or outdoor activities.

We use R program code to retrieve concert, cinema, theatre and other relevant search information from web searches and Youtube.  We produce data that is comparable across the whole CEE region. We make time-series, forecasting, benchmarking and other data analytics applications on the data. The main use is forecasting, because tickets sales are known when searched for and not after sales are reported. The granularity of the data can help to understand seasonality of months, weeks, best time for touring, for cinema scheduling.

Our [Google Trend Analytics](https://trends.google.com/trends/) is included in our private and public reports.  Google Trends is an interesting toy if you use it interactively.  Combined with regular, programmatic data extraction and surveys it is an extremely powerful tool to provide timely forecasts and to give your surveys an extra granularity in time, or down to city level.  For example, [combining seasonality analytics](http://www.ceemid.eu/music/comparing-the-demography-of-live-audiences/) with demographic analysis can explain most of the difficulties of market development in the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland or Slovakia.

## What are Music Industry Professional Surveys?

The __Music Industry Professional Surveys__ and the similar _Audiovisual Industries Professional Surveys_ were designed to fill out the gaps from other data sources.  These surveys are anonymously asking music and film professionals about their work, their royalties and other incomes, and some budgetary issues.  The CEEMID Music Professional Surveys are among the biggest musician surveys, besides the survey supporting the [UK Measuring Music Surveys]( https://www.ukmusic.org/research/measuring-music-2017/).

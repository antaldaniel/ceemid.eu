## What are CAP Surveys?

Cultural Access and Participation Surveys are standardized surveys designed to measure various market-based and non-market based (amateur, liturgical, etc.) cultural activities, including concerts, streaming subscriptions, singing, etc.  They are based on various quantative sociological models and had been standardized by the Eurostat working group [ESSNet-Culture](http://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/culture/library/reports/ess-net-report_en.pdf).

The CEEMID CAP surveys are usually live interviews that allow cross-country comparison, and they are used both for market forcasting, market analytics, royalty and compensation value setting. 

## CAP Europe 2013

We use the data of the CAP 2013 survey for cross-country comparisons and for model calibration, because it includes all EU countries.

## CAP Hungary 2018

## CAP Hungary 2017


## CAP Croatia 2017

## CAP Slovakaia 2015

## CAP Hungary 2015

## CAP Hungary 2014

## CAP EUrope 2007

We use the data of the CAP 2007 survey for understanding cross-country dynamics and long-term changes, because it includes all EU countries. For example, we can determine in which countries visit `Generation Z` 20-years-old people more concerts or cinemas than their `Generation X` and `Generation Y` peers when they were 20-years-old.

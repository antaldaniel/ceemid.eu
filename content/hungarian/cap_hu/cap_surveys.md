The copyright royalty is the wage of the music performer, composer and producer. Musicians earn their income after their recorded performances when it is played in a public performance or when it is mechanically copied.   Like wages and services in a market economy, the remuneration for the use of their work should reflect some sort of market value.  In the case of copyrighted music, this market value is a part of the added value in a service.

The following steps apply to collective rights management, which is most of rights management in the Central, Eastern and Southern European markets.  In individual rights managements, some of these techniques can be useful, but further methods can be used, because they are usually not limited to the same extent by competition law restrictions.

CEEMID, the Central Eastern European Music Industry Database was set up after a memorandum was signed by several collective management entities and my former consulting company.  Its main objective was to collect and organize data in a way that allows to calculate the economic value added of music and other relevant data for setting the price of music. CEEMID contains hundreds of indicators about music consumption, price, and related economic, sociocultural and consumption data.

The jurisprudence of the Court of the European Union has touched upon music collective royalties with increasing frequency in the last decade.  I believe that currently the most applicable case law is [Autortiesību un komunicēšanās konsultāciju aģentūra/Latvijas Autoru apvienība v Konkurences padome](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=194436&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=273330), or shortly, _AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome_. A notable precursor to this decision the one made in the Czech case between the Czech collective management organization OSA and hotels, [OSA v Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně]( http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?oqp=&for=&mat=or&lgrec=en&jge=&td=%3BALL&jur=C%2CT%2CF&num=C-351%252F12&page=1&dates=&pcs=Oor&lg=&pro=&nat=or&cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&language=en&avg=&cid=1996526). 

According the Court decision, significant differences between royalty prices on the European Single Market must be based on objective differences of economic, sociocultural factors and consumption habits.  In the past 5 years, CEEMID has collected hundreds of economic, sociocultural consumption indicators to understand the differences of European markets in live music, recorded music, and in the important connecting markets of films, software games, restaurants, hotels, tv, radio and other big users of music.

Cultural Access and Participation Surveys are standardized surveys designed to measure various market-based and non-market based (amateur, liturgical, etc.) cultural activities, including concerts, streaming subscriptions, singing, etc.  They are based on various quantative sociological models and had been standardized by the Eurostat working group [ESSNet-Culture](http://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/culture/library/reports/ess-net-report_en.pdf).

The CEEMID CAP surveys are usually live interviews that allow cross-country comparison, and they are used both for market forcasting, market analytics, royalty and compensation value setting.
